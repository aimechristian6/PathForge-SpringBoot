PathForge: Employee Management System
Here is my full-stack web application designed to streamline employee management for organizations. It features role-based dashboards for Admins, HR, and Employees, enabling secure login (email/password), employee CRUD operations, and profile picture uploads (stored as BYTEA in PostgreSQL). Admins access HR/employee reports, HR manages employee records, and Employees update personal details. The responsive UI, built with Thymeleaf and CSS, ensures a seamless experience across devices, with a BioTech-themed design and PathForge logo.
Tech Stack & Frameworks:


Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security.
Frontend: Thymeleaf, HTML5, CSS3.
Database: PostgreSQL.
Tools: Maven, Git.


My Journey:Building PathForge was a rewarding dive into full-stack development. I learned to architect a robust backend with Spring Boot, manage database interactions via JPA, and create dynamic, responsive templates with Thymeleaf. Overcoming challenges like securing authentication, optimizing queries, and ensuring UI responsiveness honed my problem-solving skills. This project fueled my passion for crafting scalable, user-focused solutions and deepened my grasp of MVC architecture and secure coding.
Skills Gained:


Backend development (RESTful controllers, services).
Database management (JPA, PostgreSQL).
Frontend design (responsive Thymeleaf templates, CSS).
Security (role-based access, CSRF protection).
Version control (Git/GitHub).

Getting Started:


Install Java 17, PostgreSQL, Maven.
